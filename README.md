# 🎬 DSER-Based Movie Recommendation System 🎯  

A **Deep-Sequential Embedding for Single-Domain Recommendation (DSER)-based** movie recommender system. The project is inspired by the research paper **["DSER: Deep-Sequential Embedding for Single Domain Recommendation"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422013306)** and implements a **hybrid recommendation model** leveraging **deep learning, Doc2Vec, collaborative filtering, and hybrid recommendation techniques** to provide personalized movie recommendations.  

## 🚀 Key Features  

- **Doc2Vec-Based User and Movie Embeddings**: Converts sequential user interactions into dense feature representations.  
- **Hybrid Recommendation Model**: Combines **Generalized Matrix Factorization (GMF)** and **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** to capture **linear and nonlinear** user–movie relationships.  
- **Large-Scale Movie Data Processing**: Utilizes **MovieLens** metadata and user ratings for training.  
- **Implicit Feedback Learning**: Transforms explicit user ratings into **implicit feedback** for better recommendation accuracy.  
- **Deep Learning Implementation**: Built using **TensorFlow/Keras**, **Gensim**, and **NumPy**.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  

- **Python**  
- **TensorFlow / Keras**  
- **Gensim (Doc2Vec)**  
- **NumPy & Pandas**  
- **Scikit-Learn**
